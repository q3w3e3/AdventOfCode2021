## backups
files in ods xlsx and tsv (of formula, not values), not all are available as export often failed on larger or more complex sheets


while day 5 has no backup currently (too large to export) it can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y2GKSC9sOqm7ORkq-gNmtVkPNgyEI0l1vJZYwOeumr8/) on google sheets, and i will attempt to get a backup of it in the future
